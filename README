A simple app that alerts you when your posture needs fixing.

What it does:
Uses your webcam to watch your posture
Alerts you when you're slouching
Works completely on your device (no data sent anywhere)

Run the app:
source test_env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 posture_gui.py

How it works:
The app uses your camera to track your body position. A machine learning model (Random Forest) analyzes your posture and decides if it's good or bad. When your posture is bad, you'll get an alert after your set timer.
